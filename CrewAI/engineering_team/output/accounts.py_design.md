## Design for `accounts.py` Python Module

This module implements a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. Below is a detailed design outline of the class and methods provided within this module:

### Class: `Account`

#### Attributes:
- `account_id: str` - Unique identifier for the account.
- `balance: float` - Current balance of the account in cash.
- `holdings: dict` - Dictionary with stock symbols as keys and quantities held as values.
- `transactions: list` - List of transactions made by the user.
- `initial_deposit: float` - Records the initial deposit to calculate profit/loss.

#### Methods:

1. **`__init__(self, account_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`**
   - **Description:** Initializes a new account with an initial deposit, setting the account ID, initial deposit, balance, and empty structures for holdings and transactions.

2. **`deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`**
   - **Description:** Allows the user to deposit additional funds into their account.
   - **Preconditions & Validation:** Amount must be positive.

3. **`withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`**
   - **Description:** Allows the user to withdraw funds, ensuring withdrawal does not lead to a negative balance. Returns `True` if withdrawal is successful, `False` otherwise.
   - **Preconditions & Validation:** Sufficient funds must be available.

4. **`buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`**
   - **Description:** Records the purchase of shares if the user has sufficient funds.
   - **Preconditions & Validation:** Checks that user has enough funds to cover purchase price.

5. **`sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`**
   - **Description:** Records the sale of shares if the user owns enough shares.
   - **Preconditions & Validation:** Checks that user has the shares available to sell.

6. **`get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`**
   - **Description:** Calculates and returns the total value of the user's portfolio (cash + value of holdings).

7. **`get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`**
   - **Description:** Calculates and returns the profit or loss since the initial deposit.

8. **`get_holdings(self) -> dict`**
   - **Description:** Returns the current holdings in the account as a dictionary.

9. **`list_transactions(self) -> list`**
   - **Description:** Returns a list of all transactions made by the user over time.

10. **`_add_transaction(self, transaction_type: str, symbol: str, quantity: int, price: float) -> None`**
    - **Description:** Internal method to log a transaction with details including type (buy/sell), symbol, quantity, and price.

### Supporting Function

- **`def get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`**
  - **Description:** This external function returns the current price of a share for the given symbol. The module uses this function to fetch share prices when buying or selling.

**Testing Implementation of `get_share_price`:**

Provides fixed prices for testing purposes:
- AAPL: 150.0
- TSLA: 700.0
- GOOGL: 2800.0

### Module Design Notes:
- All methods should include error handling and logging for robust operation.
- The external function `get_share_price` must be mocked or stubbed during unit testing to ensure predictability of tests.
- The class should support expansion by potentially integrating with real-world data feeds for share prices in the future.

By adhering to this design, a backend engineer will have the necessary blueprint to implement the account management system as per the outlined requirements.
